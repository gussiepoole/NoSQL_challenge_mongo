# Nosql_challenge
Analysis of restaurant data using MongoDB

The two notebooks use the same data. The first notebook (*'NoSQL_setup.ipynb'*) performs set up functions and the second (*'NoSQL_analysis.ipynb'*) performs the analysis.


The data (*'establishments.json'*) will need to be downloaded and placed in the same folder as the notebook files, ready for import.
